The following project was made for college work. The mailing system has GUI made in JavaFX, and provides registration and login functionality to access user account. Upon
logging in the account the user can join existing mailing lists and write to to each one of them. On the Admin account, the user can modify mailing lists and the content
inside them, including users that wrote in them.
